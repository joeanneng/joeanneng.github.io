  I’m a Business Intelligence Analyst with 3 years experience dedicated to helping business to make the most accurate decisions out of my insights. 
  I specialised in data modelling, analysis of quality metric frameworks, dashboards development and trend analysis using Structured Query Language (SQL), 
  Amazon Redshift, Gitlab and Tableau.

  Currently, a Business Intelligence Analyst at Setel Express, shop your jerseys or merchandise with us! Outside of work, I am an Airbnb manager and superhost.
  I’m also open to learning new technologies/products depending on business needs.
