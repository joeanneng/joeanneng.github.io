  Data Scientist | Remote @ Binance | MDataSc
  <br><br>
  With 4+ years of experience in blockchain, e-commerce, and logistics, I specialise in building robust machine-learning solutions that drive real business impact. Currently working remotely at Binance, I thrive at the intersection of cutting-edge crypto technology and scalable data science—helping shape the future of finance, one model at a time.
  <br><br>
  Before crypto became my full-time, I wore multiple hats: optimising supply chains, boosting conversion rates in e-commerce, and even running a successful side hustle as an Airbnb Superhost (yes, I can recommend the perfect welcome basket and debug a code in the same afternoon).
  <br><br>
  Analytical by day, curious explorer by nature—I believe great data science is equal parts rigour, creativity, and a genuine love for solving puzzles that matter. Always happy to chat about blockchain, AI, MLOps, or some of your best stories. 🚀
